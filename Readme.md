# AzureRamps

This repository is my personal project/ramping repo. The Artifacts folder contains code/templates which can be shared across several project, and should be built as generally as possible.

The other folders in this repository should be segmented by technology area and/or concept which I am attempting to improve upon. These projects/focus areas can be broken down within to create a more modular structure.
